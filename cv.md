### _Profile_

My name is Ivan and I am 27 years old. I am from a small town Novopolotsk. I lead an active lifestyle and I haven't bad habits. I regret that I didn't start learning programming earlier . So I set myself the goal of learn programming. I have everything for this :

- _perseverance_
- _desire to work full time_
- _learnability_
- _desire to constantly develop and not sit still_

I like to find solutions to various problems, write code.

```
<script>
    function solution(value){
        let revVal = value.toString().split("").reverse().join("");
        return (value == revVal) ? true : false;
         }
</script>
```

### _Education_

I started learning JavaScript on my own, I do it every day. Now I'm taking a JavaScript / Front-end course at RS School. I study English with a tutor.

### _English level - A2._
